  \begin{enumerate}[ 1.]
    \item Is the functionality correct?
    \item Are the classes named suitably?
    \item Are the functions named suitably?
    \item Is the data structure well designed and meeting all requirements or does it need improvements?
    \item Does it contain functions that can be reused later? Are they placed in a Helper class?
    \item Are existing helper functions being used? Is no duplicate functionality implemented?
    \item Are all the input arguments being validated?
    \item How will the functionalities affect the performance of the app - time and memory?
    \item Is it absolutely necessary to run it on UI thread or would a background thread suffice?
    \item Are all possible failures handled?
    \item Does it degrade gracefully in case of unknown failures?
    \item Are the best practices for app development being followed?
    \item Are the operations thread-safe?
    \item What pieces of the component can be executed in parallel?
    \item Are the layouts suitable for all screen dimensions?
    \item Are there classes which have become obsolete because of this implementation?
