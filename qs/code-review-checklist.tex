    \item Are all the fail points handled?
    \item Does it degrade gracefully in case of unknown failures?
    \item Are the app-doing level standards being followed?
    \item Are the operations thread safe?
    \item What pieces of the component can be executed in parallel?
    \item Are the layouts suitable for all the screen dimensions?
